This dataset represents use of force incidents by the New Orleans Police Department reported per NOPD Use of Force policy.  This dataset includes initial reports that may be subject to change through the review process.  This dataset reflects the most current status and information of these reports.  This dataset includes one row of data for each combination of officer that used force and subject of force during the incident.  For example, if during a use of force incident two officers used force and two people were the subject of force, there will be four rows associated with that incident in this dataset.  The number of rows in this dataset does not represent the number of times force was used by NOPD officers.  This dataset is updated nightly.
