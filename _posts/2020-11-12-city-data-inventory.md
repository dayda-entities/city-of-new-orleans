As a mandate of the New Orleans City Data Policy - Executive Order 16-01 & Policy Memorandum 135, we are taking an inventory of all City datasets. This on-going inventory process will help us to categorize and identify data that could be made publicly available. This process also assists our ability to work cross-departmentally and increases our resilience.

Why is the data inventory important? 
•	Stimulate new ideas and services. By publishing a data inventory, city departments may help to stimulate new and innovative ideas from the community. 
•	Increase internal sharing and resilience. A data inventory can also help us access information from other departments that we need to improve service delivery and resilience planning. 
•	Enabling better and more up-to-date processes. The process of publishing a data inventory will help us to realize the constraints of current City technology and processes, and then plan for future improvements. 
•	Changing how we use data. A data inventory can help empower us to change how we use, share and consume our data externally and internally, ultimately transforming data into better services for citizens and fostering continuous improvement.
