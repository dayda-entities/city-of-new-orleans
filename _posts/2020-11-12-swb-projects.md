The City and Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans are working together to implement an unprecedented capital improvement program to restore the Cityâ€™s damaged infrastructure. Using a combination of local and Federal funds, the two-billion dollar program will be the most comprehensive that our region has seen in a generation. Work will include more than 200 individual projects and consist of repairing all or portions of about 400 miles of roadway. For more information please visit http://roadwork.nola.gov/.
