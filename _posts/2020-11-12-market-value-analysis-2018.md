Our Normative Assumptions when Analyzing Markets: • Public subsidy is scarce and it alone cannot create a market; • Public subsidy must be used to leverage, or clear the path for, private investment; • In distressed markets, invest into strength (e.g., major institutions, transportation hubs, environmental amenities) – “Build from Strength”; • All parts of a city are customers of the services and resources that it has to offer; • Decisions to invest and/or deploy governmental programs must be based on objectively gathered data and sound quantitative and qualitative analysis. Preparing the MVA:1. Take all of the data layers and geocode to Census block groups.2. Inspect and validate those data layers.3. Using a statistical cluster analysis, identify areas that share a common constellation of characteristics.4. Map the result.5. Visually inspect areas of the City for conformity with the statistical/spatial representation.6. Re-solve and re-inspect until we achieve an accurate representation.
