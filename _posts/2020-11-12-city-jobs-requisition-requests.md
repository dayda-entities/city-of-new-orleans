This dataset reflects requisitions submitted to the Civil Service Department for both unclassified and classified positions. Classified positions are hired within the civil service system; unclassified positions are appointed. A requisition is the electronic document authorizing a new hire, promotion or other personnel transaction. Requisition data included here is for promotions and new hires submitted since January of 2018. Data is updated on a monthly basis.
