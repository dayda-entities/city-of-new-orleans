This dataset shows the presence of metered parking spaces. The stations are categorized by two different types, Single Space Meters (SSM) and Pay Stations (PS) for multiple spaces. Number of spaces managed by the Pay Stations is depicted in the data as well. Single space meters are indicated with a 1. All meters have a Meter ID which could be tied to tabular data which is currently in excel form. Data is updated monthly and  provided monthly by SP+.
