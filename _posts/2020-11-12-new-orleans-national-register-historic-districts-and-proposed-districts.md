A National Register historic district is a historic district that is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is our country�۪s official list of historic properties and resources worthy of preservation. It includes individual buildings, structures, sites, and objects as well as historic districts that are considered to be significant in American history, architecture, engineering, archaeology, and culture.  This dataset is the result of collaboration between the Louisiana State Historic Preservation Office, FEMA and the City of New Orleans ITI-GIS. (1) Listed districts only, (2) proposed districts or extensions which have not been listed, (0) significant historic area.Please note that these historic districts are not the same as Local Historic Districts, which have completely different criteria and laws governing permitting.
