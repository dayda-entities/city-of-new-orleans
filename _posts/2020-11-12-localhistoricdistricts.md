<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"><DIV><P><SPAN>Polygon dataset representing local New Orleans Historic Districts. Local historic districts are created to regulate, preserve, and protect historic districts and landmarks within the City of New Orleans and may or may not correspond to districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As of 2007, there are 14 local historic districts within New Orleans/Orleans Parish, ten administered by the New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission and four by the Central Business District Historic District Landmarks Commission. The City of New Orleans Department of Information Technology &amp; Innovation creates, collects and stores GIS infrastructure and other data.  Data are provided by various departments within the City, other government entities, utilities, and private enterprise.  The primary purpose for maintaining this enterprise GIS is to provide spatial analysis, decision support and mapping services to all City Departments.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>
