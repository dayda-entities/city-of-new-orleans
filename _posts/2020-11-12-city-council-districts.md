New Orleans City Council Districts, effective May 5, 2014 Voters will be placed in the districts displayed by January 1, 2014 for all future elections. Council districts are based upon the 2010 census and redistricting. Precincts are drawn according to the New Orleans Home Rule Charter. Precinct boundaries were updated September 25, 2015, in order to satisfy population changes discovered by the Orleans Registrar of Voters Office. The changes have been made by the City of New Orleans and verified by the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office.
